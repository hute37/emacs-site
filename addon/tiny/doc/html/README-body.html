            This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
            please see "t2html.pl --help" for option --script-file
            to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

            XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
            It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
            element and attribute names

	    This default CSS2 has been validated according to
	    http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

	    To design colors, visit:

            Comments on the CSS tags:

            -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

            NETSCAPE 4.05

            -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
               font size changes does not show up in screen.
            -  :hover property is not recognised

            NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

            -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
               (IE has no trouble to show it)

            MSIE 4.0+

            - Renders CSS very well.

            Media types

            - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
              the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
              or media "screen"
            - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
              to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
              just define P.column7 { ... }

            The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
            I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

            So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
            (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
            which means both print and scree types.)

                @media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

            To work around that, we separate the definitions with

                P.code { .. }               // For screen

                @media print { P.code      // for printer
                {
                    ..
                }}

            And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

        Emacs can't load additional packages if it doesn't know where they

        one by one to the <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> variable. Tiny Tools provides
        more versatile and easier path configuration as demonstrated below:


<PRE class="code">

        The CVS tree has been completely redesigned. All lisp code is now
        under lisp/, but categorized further into lisp/tiny and
        lisp/other. The documentation now includes HTML and it is no longer
        generated separately. New directories include doc/txt and
        doc/html.


<P class="column8">
        2001-07-25 Work started to make all libraries &quot;names pace clean&quot;.
        This is a pre-step to ensure that there is no incompatibilities
        with Emacs function naming and to make kit eventually an XEmacs
        package.


<P class="column8">
        2001-07-12 A new RELEASE has been uploaded to sourceforge. This is
        based on the last active snapshot 2000-04. This release contains
        renamed files, incompatible changes and whole new setup system.


<P class="column8">
        2001-05-15 The current snapshot has been in place several weeks and
        no more new features have been added. No bug reports haven't been
        reported in this period. The final release is just about ready.


<P class="column8">
        2001-03-11 New installation method provided in <EM class="word">tiny-setup.el</EM>
        which is used to configure all tools without risk of changing Emacs
        environment. The methods also helps getting the the tools running
        without configuring each package separately.


<P class="column8">
        2001-03-08 Sourceforge staff has finally solved a long
        standing problem with SSH + CVS interaction that prevented using the
        CVS from the very start of the project, back to 6 months. <STRONG class="word">You</STRONG>
        <STRONG class="word">can</STRONG> <STRONG class="word">use</STRONG> <STRONG class="word">cvs</STRONG> now to get newest development code.


<P class="column8">
        2001-03-04 Emacs 21.0.98 and other pretests have serious errors in
        cl-macs.el (dolist), so don't expect anything to work there. Bug
        report has been files Emacs pretest team and it will be fixed in
        official 21.x


<P class="column8">
        2001-01-22: <EM class="word">tinypath.el</EM> was completely redesigned and now
        it uses external perl helper script <EM class="word">emacs-util.pl</EM> which
        is much faster than the Emacs Lisp method to recurse
        deep directory structures. Took lot of work and it is not yet
        stable.


<P class="column8">
        2001-01-02: It is now possible to create <EM class="word">site-lisp</EM> directory
        directly from Emacs lisp developers' home pages. The perl
        script <EM class="word">mywebget.pl</EM> was enhanced in big leaps. To get all
        the latest code from Internet, refer to <SAMP class="word">bin/mywebget-emacs.conf</SAMP>
        and the perl script's documentation.


<P class="column8">
        Sourceforge <EM class="word">emacs-elisp.html</EM> has been completely redesigned,
        (developers are listed only in one section) and stale links
        have been removed. Index.html contains new information and
        uses BMT Internet time.


<P class="column8">
        2000-11-18: The HTML pages at sourceforge are now in place.
        Administrative tools need serious work. CVS TREE is not yet still
        functional, but a private copy is being used.


<P class="column8">
        2000-09-09: The plans to move to sourceforge and public CVS server
        has been initiated. The transition and adaption of all the building
        tools must be reprogrammed and this will take time. However,
        the official releases starting today, can be found there.


<P class="column8">
        2000-06-01: To remind all old tools users: ALL THE VARIABLE
        NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED form the original tar.gz distribution.
        They now reflect the PACKAGE prefix and not 3-4 letters as
        they used. (E.g. tinymail.el variables used to have timi- but
        they now have tinymail- prefix)


<P class="column8">
        At least Win32 XEmacs 21.2.20 does not have a built-in function to
        call native win32 applications, so TinyUrl package response to URLs
        is slow (external shellex.exe must be used). Get a newer XEmacs
        which has built-in function <SAMP class="word">mswindows-shell-execute</SAMP>.


<P class="column8">
        2000-02-12: Emacs 20.4 comes with slightly buggy C++ mode. Get version
        5.26 or newer, otherwise loading tiny-tools will disable your C++ mode.

        2000-01-08: The Unix makefile.mak format is no longer supported,
        please use the cross platform compatible Perl makefile.pl


<P class="column8">
        2000-01-08: Don't use <EM class="word">tiny-tools.tar.gz</EM>. It was last Unix based
        kit. The development continues in <EM class="word">tiny-tools-beta.zip</EM> which is
        first cross-platform Win32 buildable kit. There is no support for
        the old tar.gz and it remains in place until the
        tiny-tools-beta.zip has matured enough.

  </H2>




        This note has been dated 2000-01-08. Project is stalled/broken. No
        fixes are planned in any near future.


<P class="column8">
        Years back the coding of module TinyPgp started. Lot of
        nights and not-so-well sleep went by and there were over 300
        versions made alone with the Pgp support. It was black and deep
        swamp: different MUAs (RMAIL, VM, Gnus &ndash; beta versions every
        week), different PGP versions, 2.6.x (had so-and-so command line
        support), PGP 5.x and 6.x (that were not designed at all Unix in
        mind; they had no good batch command line support), GPG, which only
        worked at Unix at the time, and there was no way to get it compiled
        in HP-UX, also no windows version were available at that time.


<P class="column8">
        TinyPgp package offered integration to TM/SEMI to send PGP/MIME
        and supported lot of different re-mailers, direct management of
        re-mailer accounts, multiple key rings, multiple key-access methods
        to key servers and so on...


<P class="column8">
        It all worked for some time, 2 years, but the variables in this
        soup were too many for the maintainer to be able to continue
        getting them all to work together. Maintaining a single package
        drained efforts from all other projects (perl, procmail and other
        Emacs tools)


<P class="column8">
        For the time being, the TinyPgp project is in stall (perhaps not
        yet abandoned), and you can expect it to be non-functional. You can
        try it out, bug reports are welcomed, but no problems will be fixed
        in near future. All bug reports, will saved and addressed if time
        allows. There is vision to get once-excellent re-mailer
        support working again and get back to &quot;anonymous&quot; business in the
        spirit of pioneer anon.penet.fi

        It is best to use some general and easy update software which can

        There exists a cross platform Perl script which offers

<P class="column10"><EM class="quote10">
          Please read these instructions with some salt, because the
          maintainer is not 100% sure of the accuracy of this explanation.
          Please feel free to suggest corrections to this text.</EM>



<P class="column8">
        All the files in Tiny Tools kit turn on the dynamic byte
        compilation flag, which appeared in Emacs 19.29 and XEmacs 19.14.
        That's something you don't have to worry about, but I think you are
        would be interested in hearing, that it has some nice benefits over
        the normal compilation. If you say


<PRE class="code">
      (require 'tinylibm)
</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        the statement used to mean &quot;load library tinylibm&quot;. All functions
        were imported into emacs in a whip. But that's  different now with
        dynamically compiled files. Now it means &quot;load STUBS from library
        tinylibm&quot;. The STUBS are pointers in a table to all the rest of the
        functions in the library. So, the functions are not actually loaded
        to your Emacs; neither does your Emacs suffer from sudden memory
        bloat.


<P class="column8">
        When the actual function is called, Emacs automatically substitutes
        the STUB with the function definition by loading it from the
        library. Just that function, not the others. That's the benefit of
        the dynamic byte compilation in a nutshell.


<P class="column8">
        By the way, if you happen to need some function from the libraries,
        don't do this:


<PRE class="code">
      (require 'tinylimt)     ;; mail tools

<P class="column8">
        The correct way to let your emacs know about all the existing
        library functions, is to load the <EM class="word">m</EM> library. It will define
        all the necessary autoloads to rest of the function and you don't
        have to worry about the location of a particular function


<PRE class="code">
      ;;  Define everything, publish interfaces. Defines
      ;;  backward compatibility functions, autoloads etc.

        When you install packages, try to avoid loading them from your
        $HOME/.emacs like this


<PRE class="code">
      (require 'tinytab)  ;; TAB minor mode
</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        Because it means that the whole package is loaded (or STUBS) if you
        do have many <SAMP class="word">require</SAMP> commands, your Emacs startup time grows
        proportionally. You hate slow Emacs startup; right? Okay, there is
        much better way to load files; called <SAMP class="word">autoload</SAMP>. It means that you
        tell Emacs; that &quot;function exists in package xxx&quot;. When function or
        feature is called (and the autoload triggers), Emacs loads function
        from the package. Some day you don't use some feature in your emacs,
        sometimes you use, and Emacs grows and loads the packages when you
        happen to need them. No need to use <SAMP class="word">require</SAMP> to have it all at once.


<P class="column8">
        Now, if you read carefully the <EM class="word">installation</EM> section from every
        package and prefer copying the autoload setup instead, you will
        have the most optimized way to install the package to your .emacs.
        If some package doesn't have autoload choice, complain immediately
        to the Author. The package writer should have thought the autoload
        possibility too. There may also be a note that package can't be
        autoloaded, so in that case there is no other possibility that to
        <SAMP class="word">require</SAMP> it. For even more slicker and faster Emacs startup
        sequence, see package <EM class="word">TinyLoad</EM> which you can uset to optimise
        lisp file loadings even more.

        The life with Emacs evolved in the direction called &quot;Tiny
        Tools&quot;; modules that got initially written in the past years
        starting with Emacs 19.28. The current code is aimed to be
        XEmacs/Emacs Unix/NT platform independent. The cross platform could
        not be possible without following testers that patiently kept
        reporting bugs and making improvement suggestions. Most sincere
        thanks to you all.

<P><UL>
	<LI>Henk SPG <EM><A HREF="mailto:tank@xs4all.nl" >tank@xs4all.nl</A></EM> who had courage to take early v1.6x
            TinyPgp in XEmacs. I got very good feedback and bug tracing
            assistance from him.
	<LI>Samuel Tardieu <EM><A HREF="mailto:sam@inf.enst.fr" >sam@inf.enst.fr</A></EM> has been a key figure
            in  testing the PGP interfaces with 2.6.x and 5.x in Unix.
	<LI>Dan Rich <EM><A HREF="mailto:drich@cisco.com" >drich@cisco.com</A></EM> who assisted me with solving the
            XEmacs 20-21.x incompatibility problems. The correction cycle
            rolled out changes that caused rewriting my other packages too.
            In addition he suggested many other new features I didn't think
            of before. He cleared many problems by talking to XEmacs 20.x
            maintainers and if that's not all, he also made sure the
            packages worked in VM. I'm very happy that Dan came into
            picture.
	<LI>Sami Khoury <EM><A HREF="mailto:skhoury@omnisig.com" >skhoury@omnisig.com</A></EM> tried every new tiny tools
            release and reported any byte compiler errors with latest Emacs
            releases. He also suggested many improvements, many new
            features to add and sent patches. Without Sami, I would have
            not been able to know how things work in Emacs 20.x and 21.x.
            Sami was the ears and eyes in the bleeding edge Emacs
            development till the FSF opened their Emacs CVS server.
	<LI>David x callaway <EM><A HREF="mailto:dxc@xprt.net" >dxc@xprt.net</A></EM> joined the team somewhere 2000-10
            and kept asking, suggesting and reporting improvements in rapid
            fashion. That's what is needed to make all tools better. Thank
            you David, Don't stop bugging the maintainer <EM class="word">smile</EM>.
	<LI>Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <EM><A HREF="mailto:luish@germinus.com" >luish@germinus.com</A></EM> got
            interested in 2000-10 and was fascinated with the TinyPath
            (new utility) which made Emacs lisp package path configuration
            a joy. He joined the development and sent lof of patches and
	            squeezed many bugs from TinyPath. I'm impressed!

      6.3 About libraries
      
  </H2>




        The platform of these tools is any: Emacs and XEmacs, but and even
        the (FSF) Emacs versions differ a lot: new features are introduced,
        some made obsolete, multibyte support in 20.x changed character
        handling totally. It's hard to keep track of the changes, but that
        has been the primary goal. Whether you're running the brand new
        version or older one, the packages should work. Even if you change
        from Emacs to XEmacs, there should be no major problems. And
        nowadays the tools also support Win32 platform. All this means that
        the platform dependendent code is isolated to libraries and shared
        by all other modules. In order to reuse code, so that nothing is
        not duplicated anywhere, much of the code has been moved to the
        libraries.  It makes maintenance easier, when there is only one
        place where a possible broken function is. A constant process to
        remove old code from libraries is also in progress when new
        functions are found from standard Emacs distribution.

        If you're just starting to use Windows or have never heard of Unix,
        here is a short course of the terms and lingo you see all the time
        in the documentation:


<PRE class="code">
      %       MEANS: the command prompt where your cursor is
      $       MEANS: the command prompt as above, just different shell

        The shell (DOS in Win32) where you type the command does not usually
        matter, but the command you see may not be available in Win32. A crash
        course would be:


<PRE class="code">
      Unix    Windows
      -----   ------------------------------------------------------
      cp      MEANS &quot;copy&quot; command
      mv      MEANS move, which is combination of &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;del&quot;
      ls      MEANS list, which is &quot;dir&quot;
      rm      MEANS remove, which is &quot;del&quot;
      ln      MEANS link, Sorry, you're out of luck in Win32.
              --&gt; do a complete tree or file &quot;copy&quot; to destination.
      chmod   MEANS change modes, ignore these in Win32

  </H2>




        In Win32, the perl file (.pl) must be called differently that in Unix.
        In Unix you must make the files executable first, then just type their
        names to run them.


<PRE class="code">
      % chmod +x bin/*        &quot;Make all files in bin/* executable&quot;
      % cd /bin
      % makefile.pl --help     &quot;Run the perl script t2html.pl in bin/&quot;
</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        In Windows, there is no such command as <SAMP class="word">chmod</SAMP> and Windows does
        not know that perl scripts are runnable programs. You must prepend
        the perl interpreter in front of every call an possibly add <SAMP class="word">-S</SAMP> to
        instruct to search the script along your PATH variable. The
        following calls would also work in any environment:



<PRE class="code">
      dos&gt; perl bin/t2html.pl --help     (Notice &quot;perl&quot; at front)
      dos&gt; perl -S t2html.pl --help      (If you put the script along PATH)

      9.4 Changing environment settings
      
  </H2>




        The environment variables in Unix are prefixed with dollar and
        written in all caps, like talking about $PATH. Read it like this:


<PRE class="code">
      % echo $PATH         (in Unix, display variable's content)
      dos&gt; echo %PATH%     (same in Win32 dos prompt)
</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        If you're instructed to change any environment variables, you must
        open the <SAMP class="word">c:\autoexec.bat</SAMP> in Win9x with some text editor and
        modify the contents. In WinNT/2000 you must edit the start =&gt;
        Control Panel =&gt; System =&gt; Environment. Windows Millennium uses that
        too. Reboot after changes to make windows star using the new settings.
        WinNT/2000 is smarter, press &quot;Apply&quot; button in &quot;Environment&quot; dialog
        and you're all set to proceed.
