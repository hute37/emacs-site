	argument. Fixed.

2001-03-13 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>

	* makefile.pl: Removed `autouse' statements, because they seem
	to confuse some perl versions with messages:
	import errors at /usr/local/lib/perl5/autouse.pm. The startup
	time is slightly higher with all modules loaded with `use', but
	that is insignificant.
	(Autoload): Removed `die' command, because it is not strictly
	necessary to give target emacs with --binary, since the autoload
	file generation is same in Emacs and XEmacs. (I hope).

2000-05-25 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>

	for --load, becaseuse we change directories and relative ones
	supplied on command line won't work.

2000-02-19 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>

	* makefile.pl (Main): 1.13 CYGWIN FIXES.

	(sub Main): 1.6 The BINARY must not be tested insice

	we need that information.
	(sub Main): 1.7 The target for-loop now uses SWITCH and warns
	about non existing targets.
	Added missing target "dist" from the documentation.

2000-01-08 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>
