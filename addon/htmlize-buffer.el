;;; Synched up with: not in FSF

;;; Commentary:

;; This package will allow you to HTML-ize your font-lock buffers.  It
;; takes into account only the colors.  A lot of functionality could
;; be added.  Mail to <hniksic@srce.hr> to discuss features and
;; additions.  All suggestions are more than welcome.

;; This package generates correct HTML (or a semblance of it; I
;; haven't yet bothered to actually run it through a checker).  Since
;; <font> is not allowed to be within <pre>, we cheat by inserting the
;; DTD for HTML Pro.  Ha ha ha.

;; To use, just go to a buffer, and invoke `M-x htmlize-buffer', and
;; you'll be put to an HTML buffer, which you can save.  The operation
;; can take a bit of time, if your original buffer is long -- so be
;; patient.

;; This code should work under XEmacs 19.14+ and GNU Emacs 19.34+.

;; Useful additions by Ron Gut <rgut@aware.com> incorporated.
