;;; Commentary:

;;   This is a piece of simple code that will toggle between source
;;  and header files.
;;
;;   There is also a function for loading a file on the systems include
;; path - this probably shouldn't be included, but it almost makes sense
;; to have the C/C++ programmers file handling pieces of code together.
;;

;;;  Usage:

;;   Insert into your .emacs file the following line, (and eval it for
;;  immediate usage:
;;
;;   (require 'toggle-source)
;;
;;   Optionally byte compile this file, and change the default
;;  keybinding.
;;   By default the main function, `toggle-source' is bound to C-t
;;  which will clobber the transpose character function.
;;

This is a handy function that allows you to toggle between pairs
of files that are both in the same directory.
The toggling is based upon the file extension, and by default
this is setup in to make it simple to toggle between header
and implementation files for C++ developers.

For example if you are currently editting a buffer containing
the contents of \"file.cpp\" running `toggle-source' would
take you to the buffer \"file.h\" - assuming this file existed."
