Name=Attraction
Comment=Like qix, this uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. One of the most interesting ways to watch this hack is simply as bouncing balls, because their motions and interactions with each other are so odd. Sometimes two balls will get into a tight orbit around each other, to be interrupted later by a third, or by the edge of the screen. It looks quite chaotic.

Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but, ``When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken.''

Name=JigglyPuff
Comment=This little gem does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. The gist of it is that you have what is, structurally, a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. the vertices on these faces have forces on them in the form of one proportional to their distance from the surface of a sphere, and one which is proportional to how far they differ from some ideal distance from their neighbors. They also have inertia. The forces and distance are parameters and there are also a couple of visual parameters. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner. woo. It doesn't matter, however. You should just pick 'random'. It overrides all the other options, except for fps, delay and complexity. By Keith Macleod

Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. Written by Jamie Zawinski based on some cool SmallTalk code seen in in Byte Magazine in 1981. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. You can provide the image to use, as an XBM or XPM file, or tell it to grab a screen image and rotate that.

Name=IMSmap
Comment=This generates random cloud-like patterns. It looks quite different in monochrome and color. The basic idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random ``elevation''. Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Then coloration is done based on elevation. The color selection is done by binding the elevation to either hue, saturation, or brightness, and assigning random values to the others. The ``brightness'' mode tends to yield cloudlike patterns, and the others tend to generate images that look like heat-maps or CAT-scans. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski.

Comment=Loads several random images, and displays them flying in a circular formation. The circle changes speed and direction randomly, tilts on its axis, and the images move in and out. To tell it where to find the images to display, go to the "Advanced" tab on the Screensaver Preferences window. Select "Choose Random Images", and enter your image directory in the text field right below that. (Note: not the the "Advanced" button at the bottom of this window: the tab at the top of the *other* window.) This program requires a good video card capable of supporting large textures.
